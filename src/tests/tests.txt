For our tests we decided to test some of the doorways that we thought may be the
most used as theyre near starting positions of the players. We tested each direction
doorway because we thought that would be the most helpful to test
all of them not and prepare more now so we don't have to worry about stuff
not working later. We decided to also test that a room is confirmed
to be a room or not with the boolean statements where if someone is in a 
room they know they're in a room and in comparison if they're on a walkway
the boolean would return false and they would therefor know that they're
on a walkway. There's also a test that confirms the room label
matches the actual room so for example that village matches the v label 
in the board. For the boardtestsexp that was last weeks test to practice with 
the algorithm and confirm that it works in a smaller board so that it can then
be easily implemented further when we have a bigger board so then we just
have to get the adjacent correct and then the actual algorithm will work.
